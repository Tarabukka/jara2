Jara v2.1 is a lightweight blogging package that runs on PHP 5.3.x and MySQL 5.1.x. Older versions of PHP and MySQL might work, but I do not support them.

Its deprecated predecessor, Jara v2.0, was released in August 2010 after development work in the preceding months, and was released under the ISC licence.
